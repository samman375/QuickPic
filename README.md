- Assignment was completed individually in T1 2021 for COMP6080:Web Front-end Programming.
- Task was to create the frontend for a single-page web application (similar to Instagram).
- This project had a focus on understanding the mechanics of fundamental JavaScript.
- Project Spec can be found in spec.md.
- To run application:
    - **WARNING: Starting the application is currently bugged and I'm working on a fix.**
    - ~~Move all code and folders except 'backend' into a new folder named 'frontend'~~
    - ~~To run server use this command in the terminal: ```python3 -m http.server```~~
    - ~~To open the frontend use the provided url (most likely: http://localhost:8000)~~
- Some later functionality (around milestone 5-7) may not be implemented or may be bugged.
- A final mark of 79.9/100 was awarded and was worth 30% of grade.
